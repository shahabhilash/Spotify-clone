potify Clone
This project is a front-end replica of the Spotify web player user interface, built using pure HTML and CSS. The goal was to recreate the look, feel, and responsive layout of the original application to demonstrate core web development skills.

Features
Responsive Layout: The design adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Dark Theme: The user interface features Spotify's signature dark color scheme for a sleek and modern look.

Intuitive Navigation: Includes a static sidebar and a sticky navigation bar to provide a familiar and easy-to-use browsing experience.

Music Player UI: The layout incorporates a music player at the bottom of the screen with a progress bar and controls, designed to be fixed and accessible at all times.

Interactive Components: Subtle hover effects and well-designed buttons create a polished feel and enhance user interaction.

Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the fundamental structure for the entire application, including the main layout, navigation, and content sections.

CSS: Handles all the styling, from colors and fonts to the responsive grid and component positioning, to perfectly match the original application's design.
